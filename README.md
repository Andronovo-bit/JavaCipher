# JavaCipher
This project uses Substitution and Vigenere encryption - decryption operations according to the key and value given by the user using JavaFX.


Cryptography is the study of the techniques by which information could be concealed in ciphers and later revealed by legitimate users employing the secret key. Encryption is transformation of plaintext into a form (ciphertext) which is not easily understood by unauthorized people or machines. After being transformed into ciphertext, the plaintext appears random and does not reveal anything about the content of the original data. An encryption process has a corresponding decryption process. Decryption is used to reverse the encrypted data (ciphertext) back to its original content (plaintext).
